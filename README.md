Learning by doing session on how to start a Java Spring Boot Project

## Set up
There is a few options of IDEs for setting up Spring Boot project. Pivital has provided us options under https://spring.io/tools.

For this learning by doing session, we are going to use VSCode.

To set up a project, download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and [Spring Boot Extention Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-boot-dev-pack).

Since we are developing a project in Java, make sure that JDK is downloaded and configured properly.

## Test
The final result is in the develop branch. 

To test final project, please use Postman (either the Chrome extention or Desktop application).
